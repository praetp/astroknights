# Skytracker vs GoTo mount 
This document compares a skytracker (e.g. the iOptron SkyGuider Pro) vs a GoTo mount (e.g. Skywatcher HEQ-5).


| aspect                | SkyGuiderPro                                                                                   | GoTo mount                                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Polaris (NCP) visible | Required for polar alignment. Maybe after-market solutions such as iPolar can help             | Not required for polar alignment          |
| Finding target        | Very difficult without platesolving: star hopping. 5-10 minutes with platesolving              | Automatic, with "Go-to" function          |
| Guiding/Dithering     | RA only                                                                                        | RA and Dec                                |
| Weight of OTA         | Theoretically 5.5kg. In practice 3kg                                                           | Depends on your mount but definitely more |
| Mobility              | Can fit in a moderately sized backpack. Can be taken on plane                                  | Car transportation only. Heavy.           |
| Targets               | Nightscapes (wide angle), large DSO (e.g. M31, M42, M45), SSO: moon and sun only, planets hard | Anything                                  |
| Focal length          | You can go high but it gets hard. In practice max 250mm                                        | High (depends on precision and guiding)   |
| Power                 | Onboard battery powered                                                                        | 12V                                       |
| Computer control      | No                                                                                             | Yes (e.g. with EQMOD)                     |
| Budget (new)          | 500+ euro                                                                                      | 1200+ euro                                |
|                       |                                                                                                |                                           |
