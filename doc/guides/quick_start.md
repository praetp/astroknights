# Astrophotography field guide - quick start
These are the steps you have to do every evening:
- Deploy your gear (if possible in the daytime)
- Determine target and note down its coordinates
- Set focal length to intended (typically maximum).
- Acquire focus. Don't modify anymore after this point.
- Get declination right for target
- Get balance right in two axes based on eventual focal length and declination
- Polar alignment
- Target finding (you may want to use shorter focal length - don't touch the focus ring !)
- Update position in EKOS
- Set focal length right again
- Start image acquisition

## To keep in mind
