Youtube movies which I have found useful:

# Image acquisition
[Astroberry intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhryexMlzbQ): shows you don't need to write your own scrips to capture images from your DSLR in a remote way.

# Processing
[Planetary images with Siril](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyBP8H9Gi3w): really was an eye opener wrt stacking for lunar. It shows dramatic sharpness improvements with Wavelet transform and color composition to get the colors right.
