Youtube movies which I have found useful:

## Youtube
### Image acquisition
[Astroberry intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhryexMlzbQ): shows you don't need to write your own scrips to capture images from your DSLR in a remote way.

### Processing
[Planetary images with Siril](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyBP8H9Gi3w): really was an eye opener wrt stacking for lunar. It shows dramatic sharpness improvements with Wavelet transform and color composition to get the colors right.
[Creating a mineral moon astrophoto](https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/astrophotography/astrophoto-tips/create-a-mineral-moon-astrophoto/). Photoshop based but easily applicable to GIMP as well.

# Tools
[ISS Transit finder](https://transit-finder.com): know when the ISS transits moon or sun
