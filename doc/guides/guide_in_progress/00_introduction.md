# Introduction
This document intends to describe a possible workflow for beginners getting started with astrophotography.
It does not really go into the theory a lot and has a high focus on the practical aspects to keep things
fun and productive. However, learning the theory is definitely recommended.

At the very minimum you need a tripod and a DSLR camera. A tracking mount such as the iOptron SkyGuider Pro
or the SkyWatcher Star Adventurer is highly recommended. I use the former.
Other approaches to get started are definitely possible, but I can only elaborate on what I have learned from
my _own_ experience. This approach will also bring you to a reasonable level without breaking the bank. However, be prepared to
spend some money...

Make no mistake, shooting decent astrophotography photos is not an easy task and it will challenge you in many ways.
You will learn a lot about:
- Astronomy
- Photography
- Post-processing

Moreover, you may spend cold nights in remote places for your new hobby and the weather is not always cooperative.
At the end of the day (or rather, the next day), when looking at your processed photos of the night before, you will
hopefully have a proud feeling of accomplishment that it was all worth it: after all you managed to capture light
that was sent by distant stars many lightyears away. How cool is that :)

## What to shoot
In general, there are two kinds of astronomy: focus on Solar System Objects (SSO) or Deep Space Objects (DSO).
Solar System Objects are:
- the sun
- the planets and their satellites (moons)
- asteroids
- meteors
Many of these objects can be spotted with the naked eye or with basic binoculars. However, as these objects are typically small (except for the sun and the moon),
a decent telescope is required to observe and shoot them with at least some detail.

Deep Space Objects are:
- star clusters
- galaxies (including our own Milky Way)
- nebulas
- supernova remnants
- ...

They come in all different kinds of sizes: from really large (e.g. M31 Andromeda is 5 times larger than the moon in the sky) to really small.
Most of them are rather dim and only a handful can be seen with the naked eye, depending on the level of light pollution in your area.
Light pollution is expressed with a [Bortle scale](https://www.handprint.com/ASTRO/bortle.html). Have a look on [lightpollutionmap.info](https://www.lightpollutionmap.info) to determine the 
level of light pollution in your area and how far you are from a darker location. E.g. I live in a Bortle 8 area and it takes me 30 minutes by car to reach a Bortle 5 area. 
I hope the situation is better for you :)

The rest of this document is focused on Deep Space Object astrophotography but lunar is definitely feasible as well.



## Other resources
I did not learn all of this out of thin air obviously. Thanks to the Internet, there are ample high-quality resources
for self-learning. I recommend:
On YouTube:
- [Catching Photons](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSXg2T4Lqc6OHTmRE3ftLaQ). Chris is a very nice German physics teacher that explains everything from the basics.
- [AstroBackyard](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn3npsPixgoi_xLdCg9J-LQ). Trevor Jones managed to turn Astrophotography into his livelihood so he must be good, right.
