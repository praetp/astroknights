# Execution
This chapter describes everything when you are on location.

## Items to take
- tripod
- camera with fully charged battery and memory card(s). Remove the straps.
- lens
- headlight with red light
- some wide, bright colored tape (to lock the lens - against lens creep) with a pair of scissors
- dew strip if needed
- intervalometer
- light source for flats (e.g. iPad) and some white t-shirt
- sufficiently charged tracking mount and its accessories (az-alt base, dec bracket, ballhead,..)
- compass (smartphone)
- laptop ? I still need it to find the target...
- small bag for intervalometer (don't let it bungle)
- print out of the 'plan'

## Upon arrival
Preferably you do the following steps when it's not (too) dark yet.

Use the compass to get a rough idea on where to look at.
- deploy your tripod, look for a fixed stable underground
- install the altaz mount, make sure the setup is level (play with the legs of the tripod if needed)
- install skyguider pro tracking mount
- install declination bracket, (ballhead), CW shaft, CW and finally camera. The ballhead is optional. 
  In theory you can later frame the target only releasing the clutch and turning it (RA) and by turning the DEC camera mounting block (Declination),
  however it seems in practise this is not that easy so maybe the ballhead is still a good idea in the beginning ?
  Hold the camera firmly in your hand until you have completed the next step ! 
- level camera + ballhead <----> CW shaft + CW. Note that if you later move the camera on the ballhead you have to level it again.

## When it gets darker
From the moment Polaris becomes visible, you can start polar alignment.
Remember that even Polaris is not truely at the Northern Celestial Pole (NSP) so we have to correct for this
error by putting Polaris on the circle rather that in the center of the polar alignment scope.

There are apps out there that will tell you where on the 'circle' Polaris should be. 
It cannot just be 'any' place on the circle as explained [here](https://www.myastroscience.com/polaralignment).

Overview of apps:
- [Polar Clock](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.astrotools.polarclock): simple app that based on your time and location tells you where to find Polaris relative to Cassiopeia and the Big Dipper.
- [PolarFinder Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lunari.polarfinderpro): Same as Polar Clock but has nicer reticle support. For now my preferred app.
