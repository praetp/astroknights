# Intro

These images were shot on the same evening with the Redcat 51 and the ZWO ASI 533mc pro, cooled to -10 degrees C.

# Comments
With the L-Pro the stars are slightly smaller and sharper. Probably because the IR is cut off.
On the other hand, while there is clearly less light pollution, it also comes at the expense
of less signals on the galaxies... Doubtful if this the right trade.
