# Instructions for polar alignment
Instructions below assume that you are standing 'in front' of the mount: when in home position, where the lens of the telescope is.

## What to do
if negative error in azimuth: turn left knob
if positive error in azimuth: turn right knob

if negative error in altitude, it needs to go higher, turn lowest screw CW (maybe first upper crew CCW to loosen it)
if positive error in altitude, it needs to go lower, turn upper screw CW (maybe first upper crew CCW to loosen it)
