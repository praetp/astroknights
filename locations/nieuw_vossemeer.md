Location: Nieuw-Vossemeer, Netherlands
Stayed here at: https://www.airbnb.be/rooms/50693102 (Mattenburg camping)
Stayed for: 2 days in August
Light pollution: Bortle 5, SQM 20.33 
Description: Chalet at camping

The good:
- big terras with hard soil with a big table. Can definitely fit two astrophotography setups.
- North and East well visible. Trees to the West. Did not check South..
- Good Wi-Fi
- Affordable
- Reasonable privacy
- not too far: <1 hour drive

The bad:
- light pollution levels not low enough to make the trip? Is Bortle 5 worth it ? 
  Probably not. Probably only come here when combined with other activities during daytime,
  rather than coming here only to shoot photos.
- minimum stay: 2 days
