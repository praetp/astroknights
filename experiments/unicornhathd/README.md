# Unicorn hat hd integration
The unicorn hat hd has 16x16 RGB pixels.
We can use it to show the current position of the declination bracket around the RA axis.


This code was based on the [unicorn hat hd clock](https://github.com/jonathanmeaney/unicorn-hat-hd-clock).

## Requirements
You need to install:
```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-dev python3-spidev
sudo pip3 install unicornhathd
```
If you don't have a unicorn hat hd on your system: `pip3 install unicorn-hat-sim`
